## Step 7 - Remove plain text IP adresses

Notice that the data you just viewed had plain IP adresses inside of it? Let's quickly get rid of those!

Add a "mapper" to do slight modifications on the data we're sourcing here.

> `meltano add mapper transform-field`

 Then paste the following config below the `pip_url` for the `transform-field` mapper in your `meltano.yml` file.

```yaml
    mappings:
    - name: hide-ips
      config:
         transformations:
         - field_id: "ip_address"
           tap_stream_name: "raw_customers"
           type: "HASH"
```

The full configuration for the mapper `transform-field` should look like this:

 ```yaml
  mappers:
   - name: transform-field
     variant: transferwise
     pip_url: pipelinewise-transform-field
     executable: transform-field
     mappings:
     - name: hide-ips
       config:
           transformations:
           - field_id: "ip_address"
             tap_stream_name: "raw_customers"
             type: "HASH"
 ```

Now let's re-run our pipeline but this time with the mapper. You run it by calling:

> `meltano run tap-csv hide-ips target-duckdb`

To view the data again, run the helper again: 

> `./meltano_tut select_db`

## Step 8 - Celebrate your success üéâ

That was fun and quick! Now try to run 

> `meltano dragon` 

just for the fun of it! üêâ

  * **Meltano VS Code Extension**

    Do you see this little dragon on the left hand side? 
    
    ![Dragon](/meltano-ext.png)

    That's the [Meltano VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=z3z1ma.meltano-power-user). It allows you to view and add all possible taps & targets we currently have on Meltano Hub. Take a look at them!

  * **Add another target**

    Why don't you try to add a second output? Try to add `target-jsonl` and do a `meltano run tap-csv target-jsonl`.

  * **Add another tap**

    Next, try to add another tap, for instance the `tap-carbon-intensity`, play around with it and push the data into either target.
