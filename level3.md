More things you can explore inside this codespace: 

  * **Meltano VS Code Extension**

    Do you see this little dragon on the left hand side?

    That's the [Meltano VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=z3z1ma.meltano-power-user). It allows you to view and add all possible taps & targets we currently have on Meltano Hub. Take a look at them!

  * **Add another target**

    Why don't you try to add a second output? Try to add `target-jsonl` and do a `meltano run tap-csv target-jsonl`.

  * **Add another tap**

    Next, try to add another tap, for instance the `tap-carbon-intensity`, play around with it and push the data into either target.

Once you're done, head over to the docs and check out our great [**getting started tutorial**](https://docs.meltano.com/) for more details, add a [**job**](https://docs.meltano.com/reference/command-line-interface#job) **and** [**schedule**](https://docs.meltano.com/reference/command-line-interface#schedule) to easily orchestrate your extract & load processes, and [**deploy it to production**](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/production).
